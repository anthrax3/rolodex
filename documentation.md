# Documentation

## Code Assignment

Create a generic employee listing page. Include pictures, names, job titles, and anything else you see fit. Build this as if it is a simple application, rather than a flat web page. The tools you use are up to you. At Postlight we use modern tools on a modern stack, many of which we mentioned in the Front End Engineer job listing. If you need information or images of fake people, try https://randomuser.me or http://uifaces.com.

#### What we’re looking for

- Responsive design
- Use of a modern JavaScript framework to create the page or add dynamic behavior
- Clean, organized, readable code
- Use of modern build tools, libraries, and best practices for implementing them
- Documentation of your thought process
- Sensible commits and commit messages

#### What we’re not looking for

We don’t expect your visual design to be perfectly polished. We’re more interested in your implementation than your design.
It’s okay and encouraged to use existing libraries and frameworks. We don’t expect you to write everything from scratch.
We know you will be missing assets you would include in a production environment (like icons and logos). Skip those and document what would be more complete in your project in a production environment.
